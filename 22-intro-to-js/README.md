### JavaScript History
- Created by Brendan Eich in 1995
- Wanted to turn the web into something like a desktop application (SPA)
- Not related to JAVA (JS was first code named Mocha, then LiveScript)
- So vast...

### Intro to Javascript
- HTML, CSS, and JS
 - HTML content
 - CSS styling
 - JS behavior
- Set up index.html, script.js, chrome console
- script tag at the bottom of the .html file?

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Prepare/Learn
- How to Debug
- Documentation

### Difference between Ruby and JS
 - sometimes doesn't throw errors
  - Experiment: trial and error, hands on coding,
  - don't make assumptions, check for yourself
 - Explicit returns (JS is more syntactically strict)
 - Semicolons?
 - Anonymous functions
  - Everything is an object (functions)

### Object . notation vs []

### Datatypes
- What types and how many?

Primitive
- string
  - interpolation with ``
  - concatenation
- number
  - typeof to check
  - beware of floating point numbers
- boolean
  - true, false, truthy or falsey
- symbol (rarely use it)
- undefined
  - value has not been set yet
- null
  - value has been explicitly set to be nothing

Object
- object
- function
- array
